QUESTIONS:
	why PreviousEnrollment has a comments column in the grid, but not on edit?
	how does dropdown item "Save to Client Portal" work?
	on hospitilizations, a note, I would imagine they want more info on the discharge physician dropdown
	Why are there null recordtypes in the grid?
	Previous histories shows a comment column, but doesn't have it in the edit?
	We said to have cancel \ save on the left, where exactly on my edit form?
	Perhaps an alternative to having inline edit grid mode... which doesn't add up to me, is a back button where new button was?
	
===========================================================================================================
	in tasks... there is a another hospitilizations????
===========================================================================================================
	
Changing between records  ( on Records -> hospitilizations) seems broken
quick test on validation (test4)
unbreak records -> hospitilizations save
re-add _ for urls
test records (full sweep)
test back button some more	
Fix are you sure you want to leave

LOW TODO:
Move ports file to Common
trim down ports (find out which ones are un-used)
Change record ports over to the single port pair
common ports are fine, but not everything should go there
Perhaps try to connect hospitilizations into the other one
Change all import \ export to be explicit
clean up Filters... recordId vs id?
remove HospitalizationId server side
start updating history bar
Can I remove some stuff? Like am I really doing the whole dropdown (in elm Model) thing anymore?
Cleanup double select statement in controller for grid source
Change Model to Types ( the file)
The abstraction for RecordType was created, but all accross the code, I am still using the id, kinda defeats the purpose
Cleanup C# PeopleRecords, kind of tangled, but not yet. (unused stuff?) (super duplicated stuff?) [no reason to be in same class right?]
remove un-used fields in MVC list type
refactor long else if filter in load, to case of instead of if else
the grid config doesn't really need TaskId, a column could able to get it... but... without knowing the model?
There is phone number validation, any other hidden validations?
Perhaps hrefExtra doesn't really belong in grid
how to clear sort?
Clean up un-used fields (in models)

REALLY LOW TODO:
fix reload in new urls
I can optionally listen to DropDownToggle right?
Would it make sense to load grid first, then fire second request to load all the dropdown info? easy enough right
if I think it is worth any performance boost, I don't need to return userDropDown or taskDropdown unless I am on recorcTypeId of 10
It would be nice to have the Call recordings grid refresh after task edit popup closes.
When page left is disabled, you can still click it. (for pagination Grid)
For example, when you are on page 12, and you filter down to like 20 rows, the highlighted row is gone (for pagination Grid)
How can I put Elm-Make command as apart of vscode instead of needing to up arrow use recent command
	see: https://github.com/Krzysztof-Cieslak/vscode-elm/blob/master/package.json
I can optimize filter, since I don't need every filter all the time...
There has to be a better way to group up stuff... that isn't just all fields together right?
Edit Button's class name is "-Column", and I am styling that class, but if we have any columns without a name... how to handle?
	Maybe have a type, Column-With-ClassName function?
	
Note: 
	Type AutoPlay = Off | On {audio : Bool, withoutWifi: Bool }
	Should I add the form to breadcrumbs?
	Would it make sense to have knockout set everything... based on the init function?
	
Trying to avoid:
	add new facility depends on roles (see AddEditRecordsPartial)
	Task column is only shown... if... there is a task? How does that work? (let them point it out if they want it)
	put edit mode inside of grid  (but.. how?) (REQUESTED TODO)
	there seems to be a bit of logic on transfer logic... not sure how to handle or if I am already
	
On Deploy Todo:
	Validate File stuff still works
	DateTime is still correct
	Test popups
	Test DateTime conversions
	Test Saving
	Test Validation
	Test Server errors
