TODO:
dropdown item "Save to Client Portal" is busted
Make sure to fix dates on save \ load
When clicking delete, confirmation message should appear first
when page first loads, make sure to fire the there are no unsaved changes, incase another form has screwed it lol


Filter above each header
Don't sort on header click :/ oh my
Place sort icon next to header
Perhaps show default sorted?
track down why files aren't being saved correctly
don't need PatientId\recordTypeId from server anymore

for update facility\category, I am not sure if I am saving both parameters being passed

Populate the RecordTypeId from flags before loading.. somehow
	Also, change the dropdown width to be concrete, right now, during load, there is a flicker awaiting stuff


LOW TODO:
I have double border around the grids
Cleanup C# PeopleRecords, kind of tangled, but not yet. (unused stuff?) (super duplicated stuff?) [no reason to be in same class right?]
Have active row highlight?
The whole form post to javascript to ports thing is a mess, but meh.
See if I can set the rectangle to be more intelligently positioned (right now it has to do all the offsets for stuff)
FacilityId is coming from window, and it seems to like... not be there 10% of the time, lets see if we can explicitly pass it
For example, when you are on page 12, and you filter down to like 20 rows, the highlighted row is gone
When page left is disabled, you can still click it.
Re-add port \ subscription
Dropdown menu on right
Style checkboxs
Remove main.js from git
put private column stuff back in Common (see bottom of Records/Main.elm
Save request won't put form in error state if it fails
I think most of the requests right now are ignoring messages

How can I put Elm-Make command as apart of vscode instead of needing to up arrow use recent command

Edit Button's class name is "-Column", and I am styling that class, but if we have any columns without a name... how to handle?
	Maybe have a type, Column-With-ClassName function?

REQUESTED TODO:
put edit mode inside of grid  (but.. how?)

merge up Enrollment branch into Main, close Enrollment branch

REALLY LOW TODO:
Get dates displaying correctly
    Perhaps server side as string, meh, or better DateLibrary (if that's hard, scratch that)

Don't really need to have two init functions, right there is the init, and the json.load init, seems silly
