QUESTIONS:
	why PreviousEnrollment has a comments column in the grid, but not on edit?
	how does dropdown item "Save to Client Portal" work?
	CCD's has no edit mode? no way to insert into the grid, but you can view records?
		CCD's has no data in prod...
	Why are there null recordtypes in the grid?

REQUESTED TODO:
	put edit mode inside of grid  (but.. how?)

Enrollment looks weird
SendMenuMessage is really heavy for a model update function, see if I can split out somehow

Filter above each header
Don't sort on header click :/ oh my
Place sort icon next to header
show default sorted column?

The whole form post to javascript to ports thing is a mess, but meh.
See if I can set the rectangle to be more intelligently positioned (right now it has to do all the offsets for stuff)
FacilityId is coming from window, and it seems to like... not be there 10% of the time, lets see if we can explicitly pass it
For example, when you are on page 12, and you filter down to like 20 rows, the highlighted row is gone
When page left is disabled, you can still click it.

Dropdown menu on right
Style checkboxs
Remove main.js from git
