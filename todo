QUESTIONS:
	why PreviousEnrollment has a comments column in the grid, but not on edit?
	how does dropdown item "Save to Client Portal" work?
	CCD's has no edit mode? no way to insert into the grid, but you can view records?
		CCD's has no data in prod...
	Why are there null recordtypes in the grid?
	Previous histories shows a comment column, but doesn't have it in the edit?
	We said to have cancel \ save on the left, where exactly on my edit form?
	Perhaps an alternative to having inline edit grid mode... which doesn't add up to me, is a back button where new button was?

	
REQUESTED TODO:
	put edit mode inside of grid  (but.. how?)

validations

don't show highlight for keyboard when mouse is selecting (or vice versa)
keyboard search not working
re-add missing dropdown css (scrollbar)
implement save
test save
look for TODO, clean up

on load if any language \ phone or address is empty, pre-fill with 1 (test)

server call is happening twice (contacts is still calling it) (send it json value)

stuff like primaryAddressIndex
zipcode is numberonly?
maxlength attributes?

test Contact Hours still works

Radio button events for the three nested controls

redesign Dropdown to work more like filter function works, right now primary complaints
	I have to specifiy the text for the dropdown,
	I need to specific the list data in the load, but I don't know that data yet (Better to send it in the view)
	The init function is really long, I only really want the initial selected Index
	(Note, bring over port code)


-----------------------------------------------------------------

todo, missing title (see _demographics.cshtml)

test all the little alignments

-----------------------------------------------------------------            

rounded buttons? 
and css popup? 

Task column is only shown... if... there is a task? How does that work?
Create add new in edit
Implement Hospitalizations
there seems to be a bit of logic on transfer logic... not sure how to handle or if I am already

LOW TODO:


REALLY LOW TODO:
if I think it is worth any performance boost, I don't need to return userDropDown or taskDropdown unless I am on recorcTypeId of 10
remove un-used fields in MVC list type
Cleanup C# PeopleRecords, kind of tangled, but not yet. (unused stuff?) (super duplicated stuff?) [no reason to be in same class right?]
It would be nice to have the Call recordings grid refresh after task edit popup closes.
When page left is disabled, you can still click it. (for pagination Grid)
For example, when you are on page 12, and you filter down to like 20 rows, the highlighted row is gone (for pagination Grid)
How can I put Elm-Make command as apart of vscode instead of needing to up arrow use recent command
	see: https://github.com/Krzysztof-Cieslak/vscode-elm/blob/master/package.json
recordTypeId should be a maybe type, there are hacks all over keeping from that
I can optimize filter, since I don't need every filter all the time...
refactor long else if filter in load, to case of instead of if else
Edit Button's class name is "-Column", and I am styling that class, but if we have any columns without a name... how to handle?
	Maybe have a type, Column-With-ClassName function?
