QUESTIONS:
	why PreviousEnrollment has a comments column in the grid, but not on edit?
	how does dropdown item "Save to Client Portal" work?
	CCD's has no edit mode? no way to insert into the grid, but you can view records?
		CCD's has no data in prod...
	Why are there null recordtypes in the grid?
	Previous histories shows a comment column, but doesn't have it in the edit?
	We said to have cancel \ save on the left, where exactly on my edit form?
	Perhaps an alternative to having inline edit grid mode... which doesn't add up to me, is a back button where new button was?
	
===========================================================================================================

TODO: 
validation errors don't have . at the end
validation error for phone numbers aren't formatted


call recording bombs out on add (fk exception? is this what test4 does?)

save to client portal looks borked... but I remember... that was just meh? Check bugs

LOW TODO:

initial sort? Verify if it is just Date on call recordings
column widths (call recordings, and others?)

PreferredLanguageIndex does nothing, remove it
change table over to maybe list, (if List is nothing, don't display no records found, but if the list exists and its length == 0 then, display no records found)
currently, mouse active class shows active row highlight on empty grid

REALLY LOW TODO:
Show search in dropdown as an option (or as an init thing)
It would be nice to have the Call recordings grid refresh after task edit popup closes.
When page left is disabled, you can still click it. (for pagination Grid)
For example, when you are on page 12, and you filter down to like 20 rows, the highlighted row is gone (for pagination Grid)
recordTypeId should be a maybe type, there are hacks all over keeping from that
move Table.elm to Common folder
