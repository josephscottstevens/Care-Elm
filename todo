QUESTIONS:
	why PreviousEnrollment has a comments column in the grid, but not on edit?
	how does dropdown item "Save to Client Portal" work?
	CCD's has no edit mode? no way to insert into the grid, but you can view records?
		CCD's has no data in prod...
	Why are there null recordtypes in the grid?
	Previous histories shows a comment column, but doesn't have it in the edit?
	We said to have cancel \ save on the left, where exactly on my edit form?
	Perhaps an alternative to having inline edit grid mode... which doesn't add up to me, is a back button where new button was?

	
REQUESTED TODO:
	put edit mode inside of grid  (but.. how?)
	
===========================================================================================================

get row dropdown back
make sure I didn't undo any completed tasks

test that all the columns in records back
make sure the row dropdown shows right stuff

has changes js error when click on checkbox in contacts
test Contact Hours still works (load and save)
fix save button being in the middle of the form
oh crap... test new patient as well
can I get a non-global copy of vmDemographics? (think I am currently killing contacts page)
look for TODO, clean up	

convert over other dropdowns ? performance is like.... 1600ms to 80
server call is happening twice (contacts is still calling it) (send it json value)
PreferredLanguageIndex does nothing
suffixDropdown's min width is too small
	re-think dropdown min-width

-----------------------------------------------------------------
don't show highlight for keyboard when mouse is selecting (or vice versa)
keyboard search not working
you can arrow up on dropdown and get no item selected, even though the dropdown doesn't support that

ideally the scrolltoDomId stays in center like sf does. (on arrow keys when dropdown is open)

todo, missing title (see _demographics.cshtml)

test all the little alignments

-----------------------------------------------------------------            


rounded buttons? 
and css popup? 

Task column is only shown... if... there is a task? How does that work?
Create add new in edit
Implement Hospitalizations
there seems to be a bit of logic on transfer logic... not sure how to handle or if I am already

LOW TODO:


REALLY LOW TODO:
if I think it is worth any performance boost, I don't need to return userDropDown or taskDropdown unless I am on recorcTypeId of 10
remove un-used fields in MVC list type
Cleanup C# PeopleRecords, kind of tangled, but not yet. (unused stuff?) (super duplicated stuff?) [no reason to be in same class right?]
It would be nice to have the Call recordings grid refresh after task edit popup closes.
When page left is disabled, you can still click it. (for pagination Grid)
For example, when you are on page 12, and you filter down to like 20 rows, the highlighted row is gone (for pagination Grid)
How can I put Elm-Make command as apart of vscode instead of needing to up arrow use recent command
	see: https://github.com/Krzysztof-Cieslak/vscode-elm/blob/master/package.json
recordTypeId should be a maybe type, there are hacks all over keeping from that
I can optimize filter, since I don't need every filter all the time...
refactor long else if filter in load, to case of instead of if else
Edit Button's class name is "-Column", and I am styling that class, but if we have any columns without a name... how to handle?
	Maybe have a type, Column-With-ClassName function?

	DateTime is still correct
	Test popups
	Test DateTime conversions
	Test Saving
	Test Validation
