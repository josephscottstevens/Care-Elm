QUESTIONS:
	why PreviousEnrollment has a comments column in the grid, but not on edit?
	how does dropdown item "Save to Client Portal" work?
	CCD's has no edit mode? no way to insert into the grid, but you can view records?
		CCD's has no data in prod...
	Why are there null recordtypes in the grid?

REQUESTED TODO:
	put edit mode inside of grid  (but.. how?)
	
===========================================================================================================

all of the html controls need optional types, having to butcher all my model to satisfy is required bs
Validation is a bit meh, a bit of duplicated code, and had to convert everything to string to validate
Edit Button's class name is "-Column", and I am styling that class, but if we have any columns without a name... how to handle?
	Maybe have a type, Column-With-ClassName function?

In Recording add new, user is actually required.
As is CallSid, and Recording Sid
	
Create add new in edit
Implement Hospitalizations

Filter above each header
Don't sort on header click :/ oh my
Sort, like sorts twice, because of initial sort on Call Recordings
oh my... haha... when they change recordTypeId from Category, need to change the edit view
there seems to be a bit of logic on transfer logic... not sure how to handle or if I am already
Try and find some better icons for the dropdown menu

LOW TODO:
Have active row highlight?
I have double border around the grids
Style checkboxs


REALLY LOW TODO:
if I think it is worth any performance boost, I don't need to return userDropDown or taskDropdown unless I am on recorcTypeId of 10
remove un-used fields in MVC list type
Cleanup C# PeopleRecords, kind of tangled, but not yet. (unused stuff?) (super duplicated stuff?) [no reason to be in same class right?]
It would be nice to have the Call recordings grid refresh after task edit popup closes.
When page left is disabled, you can still click it. (for pagination Grid)
For example, when you are on page 12, and you filter down to like 20 rows, the highlighted row is gone (for pagination Grid)
How can I put Elm-Make command as apart of vscode instead of needing to up arrow use recent command
