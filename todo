QUESTIONS:
	why PreviousEnrollment has a comments column in the grid, but not on edit?
	how does dropdown item "Save to Client Portal" work?
	CCD's has no edit mode? no way to insert into the grid, but you can view records?
		CCD's has no data in prod...
	Why are there null recordtypes in the grid?
	Previous histories shows a comment column, but doesn't have it in the edit?
	We said to have cancel \ save on the left, where exactly on my edit form?
	Perhaps an alternative to having inline edit grid mode... which doesn't add up to me, is a back button where new button was?

	
REQUESTED TODO:
	put edit mode inside of grid  (but.. how?)

LOW TODO:

Cleanup C# PeopleRecords, kind of tangled, but not yet. (unused stuff?) (super duplicated stuff?) [no reason to be in same class right?]
It would be nice to have the Call recordings grid refresh after task edit popup closes.
When page left is disabled, you can still click it. (for pagination Grid)
For example, when you are on page 12, and you filter down to like 20 rows, the highlighted row is gone (for pagination Grid)
How can I put Elm-Make command as apart of vscode instead of needing to up arrow use recent command
	see: https://github.com/Krzysztof-Cieslak/vscode-elm/blob/master/package.json
recordTypeId should be a maybe type, there are hacks all over keeping from that
I can optimize filter, since I don't need every filter all the time...
refactor long else if filter in load, to case of instead of if else
Edit Button's class name is "-Column", and I am styling that class, but if we have any columns without a name... how to handle?
	Maybe have a type, Column-With-ClassName function?
	
On Deploy Todo:
	Validate File stuff still works
	DateTime is still correct
	Test DateTime conversions
	Test Saving
	Test Validation
	Test Server errors
	
NOTE:
	I am getting random errors on grid... cannot append child of null... maybe a bad flag? (see if I can replicate without hard refresh)
