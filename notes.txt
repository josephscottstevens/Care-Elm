TODO:
Populate Category data with js data
Populate Facility dropdown with real data
Template the other Record types
After viewing file, close dropdown
Make sure filename is getting saved
Display Date Collected with time
Make sure to fix dates on save \ load
When clicking delete, confirmation message should appear first
When you click away from dropdown menu, it doesn't close, you have to click the button again
Add the other dropdown options

Filter above each header
Don't sort on header click :/ oh my
Place sort icon next to header
Perhaps show default sorted?

LOW TODO:
Have active row highlight?
The whole form post to javascript to ports thing is a mess, but meh.
See if I can set the rectangle to be more intelligently positioned (right now it has to do all the offsets for stuff)

For example, when you are on page 12, and you filter down to like 20 rows, the highlighted row is gone
When page left is disabled, you can still click it.
Re-add port \ subscription
Dropdown menu on right
Style checkboxs
Remove main.js from git


REALLY LOW TODO:
Get dates displaying correctly
    Perhaps server side as string, meh, or better DateLibrary (if that's hard, scratch that)

Don't really need to have two init functions, right there is the init, and the json.load init, seems silly
