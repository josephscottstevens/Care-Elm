TODO:
After viewing file, close dropdown
Delete some of the bad data in the grid
Make sure filename is getting saved
View record is returning... ASH now? Frig, is it because of the darn Form post nonse, GRR!
Template the other Record types
Populate Facility dropdown with real data
Populate Category data with js data
When clicking delete, confirmation message should appear first
When you click away from dropdown menu, it doesn't close, you have to click the button again
Add the other dropdown options

LOW TODO:
The whole form post to javascript to ports thing is a mess, but meh.

Filter above each header
For example, when you are on page 12, and you filter down to like 20 rows, the highlighted row is gone
When page left is disabled, you can still click it.
Re-add port \ subscription
Dropdown menu on right
Style checkboxs
Remove main.js from git


REALLY LOW TODO:
Get dates displaying correctly
    Perhaps server side as string, meh, or better DateLibrary (if that's hard, scratch that)

Don't really need to have two init functions, right there is the init, and the json.load init, seems silly
